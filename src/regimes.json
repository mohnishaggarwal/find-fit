Individuals who powerlift are focused on strength and functional performance as opposed to physique. Strength is measured through three main exercises: Squat, Bench, Deadlift. These exercises are compound movements that target a wide array of muscles. Powerlifting is about achieving the maximum possible squat, bench, and deadlift that one’s genetics allows for. Even though powerlifting is about maximizing the weight on the bar, these movements do have a learning curve. It is very important to worry about technique instead of weight when one first starts powerlifting.",
