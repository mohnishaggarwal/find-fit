Individuals who powerlift are focused on strength and functional performance as opposed to physique. Strength is measured through three main exercises: Squat, Bench, Deadlift. These exercises are compound movements that target a wide array of muscles. Powerlifting is about achieving the maximum possible squat, bench, and deadlift that oneâ€™s genetics allows for. Even though powerlifting is about maximizing the weight on the bar, these movements do have a learning curve. It is very important to worry about technique instead of weight when one first starts powerlifting.",
